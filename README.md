# Intel Bug Detection Project

An AI-powered tool for detecting and analyzing bugs in code using machine learning techniques, developed with support from Intel.

## Project Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning models to detect potential bugs in source code, helping developers identify and fix issues early in the development process. The system uses transformer-based architecture to analyze code patterns and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Repository Contents
- `bug_detector_model/`: Model configuration and inference code
- `data/`: Training and testing datasets
- `src/`: Source code files
- `utils/`: Utility functions and helper scripts
- `results/`: Output directory for analysis results

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mainudheen/Mainudheen-intel-mine.git
cd Mainudheen-intel-mine
```

### 2. Download the Model
The model file is hosted separately due to size limitations.
- Download `model.safetensors` (475.52 MB) from:
  https://huggingface.co/MainuDheen/intel-bug-detection/resolve/main/model.safetensors
- Place it in the `bug_detector_model/` directory

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- torch>=1.9.0
- transformers>=4.0.0
- numpy>=1.19.5
- pandas>=1.3.0

## Usage

### 1. Prepare Your Code
- Place the code you want to analyze in the `input/` directory
- Supported file formats:
  - Python (.py)
    

### 2. Run the Bug Detection
```bash
python main.py --input_file your_code.py
```

### 3. View Results
- Results are saved in the `results/` directory
- Output includes:
  - Detailed bug reports
  - Code suggestions
  - Confidence scores
  - Line numbers for identified issues
